# Security-Bonus-Assignment-
Class assignment that simulates a Unicode stream cipher

# Files
[Encrypt Program (bonusEncrypt.cpp)](https://github.com/max-kaiser-soft/Unicode-Stream-Cipher-Simulation/blob/main/bonusEncrypt.cpp)

[Decrypt Program (bonusDecrypt.cpp)](https://github.com/max-kaiser-soft/Unicode-Stream-Cipher-Simulation/blob/main/bonusDecrypt.cpp)

[Sample Letter File (letter.txt)](https://github.com/max-kaiser-soft/Unicode-Stream-Cipher-Simulation/blob/main/letter.txt)


# Directions
Download and compile both C++ programs (bonusEncrypt.cpp and bonusDecrypt.cpp) into the same directory alongside the sample letter text file (letter.txt).

The contents of the letter text file (letter.txt) can be edited but the name needs to be remained unchanged. Redownload and replace the file if there is a naming issue.

The Encryption program (bonusEncrypt.cpp) will read the letter text file (letter.txt) and will generate a key text file (key.txt) and an encrypted message text file (secret.txt) into the same directory.

Do not edit any of these newly generated text files.

The Decryption program (bonusDecrypt.cpp) will read the key text file (key.txt) and the encrypted message text file (secret.txt) and will generate a Decrypted message text file (message.txt) into the same directory. This file's contents should match the original letter text file (letter.txt).

The Decrypted message text file (message.txt) will generate even if there are no input files, it will just be blank.

Files will overwrite where necessary.
